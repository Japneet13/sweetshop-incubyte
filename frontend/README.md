## My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT

### How I Used AI
- I used ChatGPT to clarify backend architecture decisions and REST API design.
- I used it to debug authentication, JWT handling, and role-based authorization issues.
- I used ChatGPT to help structure automated tests using Jest and Supertest.
- I also used AI assistance to refine UI structure and CSS styling decisions on the frontend.

### Reflection on AI Impact
AI significantly improved my development efficiency by helping me quickly identify bugs,
validate architectural choices, and refine my implementation. However, all logic,
business rules, and final code decisions were reviewed, understood, and implemented by me.
AI served as a development assistant rather than a replacement for problem-solving or design decisions.
